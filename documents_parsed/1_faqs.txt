A7: If there is a mistake in the recipient's details, double check the details. Some banks may still process the transfer but it will take longer, or they might send the money back.

Q8: How can I speed up the process if the money has been sent but not settled in the recipient's account?

Q9: What impact do weekends and holidays have on money transfers?
A9: If you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day because banks are closed.
